🤖 Artificial-Intelligence-Internship-Repository

Welcome to my Artificial Intelligence Internship Repository!
This repository highlights my journey, projects, and learnings while exploring AI concepts, algorithms, and practical applications. Each task focuses on solving real-world problems with Python, AI frameworks, and logical thinking.

📝 Internship Tasks
🔹 Task 1: Chatbot with Rule-Based Responses

A beginner-friendly chatbot designed for simple conversational interactions.
✨ Features:

Responds to greetings and user queries.

Shares jokes, fun facts, and self-introductions.

Tells the current time when asked.

Ends the session when the user types "bye".

📌 This project introduces natural language processing basics and serves as a great starting point for building conversational AI in Python.

🔹 Task 2: Tic-Tac-Toe Game with AI

An interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game powered by the Minimax algorithm to challenge players.
✨ Features:

Single-player mode against an AI opponent.

Multiplayer mode for two users.

User-friendly Tkinter GUI with intuitive controls.

Easy game reset for a smooth experience.

📌 Perfect for understanding game logic, GUI design, and AI decision-making using Python.

🔹 Task 3: Rule-Based Movie Recommendation System

A simple recommendation engine to suggest movies based on user preferences.
✨ Features:

Users can filter by genre, director, or actors.

Matches preferences with stored attributes to suggest movies.

Framework for future upgrades like ML-based or personalized recommendations.

📌 This project introduces the logic behind recommender systems and sets the stage for advanced algorithms.

🚀 Key Learnings

✔️ Fundamentals of NLP through chatbots.
